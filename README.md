# Forge University

This project contains a Forge app written in Javascript that displays `Hello World!` in a Jira issue panel. 

See [developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge) for documentation and tutorials explaining Forge.

## Requirements

See [Set up Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/set-up-forge/) for instructions to get set up.

## How to

1. After setting up your development environment, run `forge create` from your terminal.
2. Name your app. eg `hello-university`
3. Select `Jira` as your context
4. Select `UI Kit` as your category
5. Select `jira-issue-panel` as your template 
    (see below for an example of what you'll see in the terminal window)

    ```
    mpaisley@L2917Y9CXH Forge University % forge create

    Creating an app in your current directory:

        /Users/mpaisley/Atlassian/Projects/Forge University

    Press Ctrl+C to cancel.

    Name your app. The app name can include dashes, spaces, and underscores.

    ? Enter a name for your app: university

    Start with a template. Each template contains the required files to be a valid app.

    ? Select a context: Jira
    ? Select a category: UI Kit
    ? Select a template: jira-issue-panel

    ✔ Creating app...

    ℹ Downloading template
    ℹ Registering app
    ℹ Creating environments
    ℹ Installing dependencies

    ✔ Created university

    Your app is ready to work on, deploy, and install. We created 3 environments you can deploy to: production, staging, development.

    Change to directory university to see your app files.
    ```
6. Once your app has been created, you can open the app directory in your preferred IDE. For example visual studio code. 
7. *Usually here we'd explain the app structure and what has been generated by the app template* 


- Modify your app frontend by editing the `src/frontend/index.jsx` file.

- Modify your app backend by editing the `src/resolvers/index.js` file to define resolver functions. See [Forge resolvers](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/runtime-reference/custom-ui-resolver/) for documentation on resolver functions.

- Build and deploy your app by running:
```
forge deploy
```

- Install your app in an Atlassian site by running:
```
forge install
```

- Develop your app by running `forge tunnel` to proxy invocations locally:
```
forge tunnel
```

### Notes
- Use the `forge deploy` command when you want to persist code changes.
- Use the `forge install` command when you want to install the app on a new site.
- Once the app is installed on a site, the site picks up the new app changes you deploy without needing to rerun the install command.
